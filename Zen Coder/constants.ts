    description: `Given an array of integers \`nums\` and an integer \`target\`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to \`target\`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.`,

      {
        input: "nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9",
        output: "[0,1]",
        explanation: "Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]."

        output: "[1,2]"
      },
      {
        input: "nums = [3,3], target = 6",
        output: "[0,1]"
      }

    # Your code here

        diff = target - num

    solutionExplanation: "This solution uses a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to achieve a single-pass O(n) time complexity. By storing numbers it has already seen, it can instantly check if the complement of the current number exists in the map.",
    solutionInDepth: `
**The Core Idea:**
The brute-force approach would be to check every pair of numbers, which is slow (O(nÂ²)). We can do much better by using a hash map, which provides constant-time O(1) lookups. The goal is to trade a little bit of space (for the hash map) to gain a lot of time.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1.  **Initialize a Hash Map:** We create an empty hash map called \`seen\`. This map will store the numbers we have encountered so far as keys and their corresponding indices as values. (e.g., \`{number: index}\`).
2.  **Iterate Through the Array:** We loop through the \`nums\` array once, keeping track of both the index (\`i\`) and the value (\`num\`).
3.  **Calculate the Complement:** For each number \`num\`, we calculate the difference required to reach the target: \`diff = target - num\`. This \`diff\` is the number we need to find in the rest of the array.
4.  **Check the Hash Map:** Here's the magic. We check if this \`diff\` already exists as a key in our \`seen\` map.
    *   If **it exists**, it means we have found our pair! The value associated with \`seen[diff]\` is the index of the first number, and the current index \`i\` is the index of the second number. We can immediately return \`[seen[diff], i]\`.
    *   If **it does not exist**, it means we haven't found the pair yet.
5.  **Store the Current Number:** We add the current number and its index to the \`seen\` map: \`seen[num] = i\`. This prepares us for future iterations. If a later number needs the current number to form a pair, it will find it in the map.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** because we iterate through the array of 'n' elements only once. Each lookup and insertion in the hash map takes, on average, O(1) time.
*   **Space Complexity: O(n)** because, in the worst-case scenario, we might have to store all 'n' elements in the hash map.

    title: 'Valid Parentheses',
    difficulty: 'Easy',
    description: `Given a string \`s\` containing just the characters \`(\`, \`)\`, \`{\`, \`}\`, \`[\` and \`]\`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.`,
    examples: [
      {
        input: 's = "()"',
        output: "true"
      },
      {
        input: 's = "()[]{}"',
        output: "true"
      },
      {
        input: 's = "(]"',
        output: "false"
      }
    ],
    starterCode: `def isValid(s):
    # Your code here
    pass
`,
    solutionCode: `def isValid(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
`,
    solutionExplanation: "This problem is a perfect use case for a stack. When we see an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the stack; otherwise, the string is invalid.",
    solutionInDepth: `
**The Core Idea:**
This problem is all about order and pairing. The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) behavior of a stack is ideal for this. The most recently opened bracket must be the first one to be closed.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
1.  **Initialize a Stack:** We'll use a list as our \`stack\`.
2.  **Define Bracket Mappings:** A hash map is useful to store the relationship between closing and opening brackets, like \`{ ")": "(" }\`. This makes checking for pairs easy.
3.  **Iterate Through the String:** We loop through each character (\`char\`) in the input string \`s\`.
4.  **Handle Closing Brackets:** If the current \`char\` is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a key in our \`mapping\`), we need to check for a match.
    *   First, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no opening bracket to match with, so the string is invalid. We pop from the stack.
    *   We compare the popped element with the value from our mapping (e.g., for ')', we expect '('). If they don't match, the order is wrong, and the string is invalid.
5.  **Handle Opening Brackets:** If the current \`char\` is an opening bracket (i.e., not a key in our \`mapping\`), we simply push it onto the stack. We're "opening" a new pair that needs to be closed later.
6.  **Final Check:** After the loop finishes, a valid string will have an empty stack. This is because every opening bracket would have been matched with a closing bracket and popped off. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unclosed opening brackets, so the string is invalid. We return \`not stack\`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** because we traverse the given string of length 'n' only once.
*   **Space Complexity: O(n)** because, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., "(((((")), we push all the brackets onto the stack.
