  "description": "<h2>Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days</h2><p>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within <code>days</code> days.</p><p>The <code>ith</code> package on the conveyor belt has a weight of <code>weights[i]</code>. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by <code>weights</code>). It is not allowed to load weight more than the <strong>maximum weight capacity</strong> of the ship.</p><p>Return the <strong>least weight capacity</strong> of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within <code>days</code> days.</p><h3>Examples</h3><ul><li><strong>Input:</strong> <code>weights = [2,4,6,1,3,10], days = 4</code><br><strong>Output:</strong> <code>10</code><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>1st day: [2]<br>2nd day: [4,6]<br>3rd day: [1,3]<br>4th day: [10]</li><li><strong>Input:</strong> <code>weights = [1,2,3,4,5], days = 5</code><br><strong>Output:</strong> <code>5</code><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>1st day: [1], 2nd day: [2], 3rd day: [3], 4th day: [4], 5th day: [5]</li><li><strong>Input:</strong> <code>weights = [1,5,4,4,2,3], days = 3</code><br><strong>Output:</strong> <code>8</code><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>1st day: [1,5], 2nd day: [4,4], 3rd day: [2,3]</li></ul><h3>Constraints</h3><ul><li><code>1 <= days, weights.length <= 50000</code></li><li><code>1 <= weights[i] <= 500</code></li></ul>",
