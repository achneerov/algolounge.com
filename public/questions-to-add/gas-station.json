  "description": "<h2>Gas Station</h2><p>Leetcode 134. Gas Station</p><p></p><p>There are `n` gas stations along a circular route. You are given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost` where:</p><p></p><p>* `gas[i]` is the amount of gas at the `ith` station.</p><p>* `cost[i]` is the amount of gas needed to travel from the `ith` station to the `(i + 1)th` station. (The last station is connected to the first station)</p><p></p><p>You have a car that can store an unlimited amount of gas, but you begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p><p></p><p>Return the starting gas station's index such that you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. If it's impossible, then return `-1`.</p><p></p><p>It's guaranteed that at most one solution exists.</p><h3>Examples:</h3><ul><li>Input: gas = [1,2,3,4], cost = [2,2,4,1]<br><br>Output: 3<br>Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 4 - 2 + 2 = 4\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 4 - 2 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. Your tank = 5 - 4 + 4 = 5</li><li>Input: gas = [1,2,3], cost = [2,3,2]<br><br>Output: -1<br>You can't start at station 0 or 1, since there isn't enough gas to travel to the next station.\nIf you start at station 2, you can move to station 0, and then station 1. \nAt station 1 your tank = 0 + 3 - 2 + 1 - 2 = 0.\nYou're stuck at station 1, so you can't travel around the circuit.</li></ul><h3>Constraints:</h3><ul><li> `1 <= gas.length == cost.length <= 1000`</li><li> `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 1000`</li></ul>",
